Loading firmware on Expansion board can be done using Teraterm or kermit


1. Make sure that the switches on the expansion board are towards UART side.

2. For updating the SiWx917 Firmware, refer [Updating the RS9116 Firmware](https://docs.silabs.com/rs9116/wiseconnect/2.0/update-evk-firmware). Instructions are the same for both SiWx917 and RS9116.
3. Once that is done make sure to make switches back to Expansion mode, while using it with the host platform.
