# Prerequisites

These pages explain the [**hardware**](./HARDWARE_REQUIREMENTS.md) and [**software**](./SOFTWARE_REQUIREMENTS.md) prerequisites for working with the Silicon Labs Matter products.

The [**artifacts page**](./ARTIFACTS.md) provides links to pre-built software image "artifacts" that can be
used to set up the Matter Demo for the Thread and Wi-Fi use cases.
